Then one day he played the bass at an impromptu jazz gig with his piano playing friend Kevin. In way over his head and just making it up, he realized that the bass fit him best. He got an upright (Ella) and a Fender Jazz (Debbie) and lives in the basement now.<br><br>“If it can groove, I want to play it. I like a puzzle every so often, but what I really want is to feel the music and get lost in the vibe.”"
